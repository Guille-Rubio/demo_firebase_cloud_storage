# Firebase Cloud Storage

Web Frontend workshop with Firebase Cloud Storage. 

Cloud Storage is a powerful, simple, and cost-effective object storage service built for Google scale. Allows you to file uploads and downloads for your Firebase apps. You can use Firebase SDKs to store images, audio, video, or other user-generated content.

In this example you will see:
- HTML Form to Upload multiple images
- Retrieve all images and show them in the front

Just paste your firebase configuration object.
